# Data-Analysis

This is a data assignment report for the course IDS 702.

This report attempts to analyze the harmful impact of smoking on the chances of pre-term birth among newborns with the help of a logistic regression model. This is done using the “smoking.csv” dataset, and by developing a model after considering the AIC and BIC step- wise and forward-built models, taking into account the accuracy and reasonableness. The model thus formed suggests that the chances of pre-term birth are significantly associated with smoking, the pregnant mother’s race, weight, education and her smoking habit given her education. It, thus, finds that the chances of pre-term birth are associated with demo- graphics, physiology and smoking. Moreover, it finds that smoking during pregnancy may be a characteristic associated with higher pre-term births, but is not very significant and that demographic and physiological factors have stronger associations .
